# NAND2Tetris-Hardware

This repository contains the codes for the hardware part of the NAND2Tetris course.
NAND2Tetris is a twelve-part course in fundamental computer engineering that steps you through the creation of a computer 
from the ground up, starting with NAND logic gates and ending with an operating system capable of running a complicated 
program like Tetris.
